I know there are a lot of react google map integration, but, as a practice, I decided to move on with plain google map API.

### How to run
If you do not have NodeJS and npm installed, please download from official website

After you have NodeJS and npm installed, install bower using npm, then run the following command:

    npm install
  
    bower install

Javascript is already committed, but if you want to compile it your self, run:

    grunt
  
After you start the server with: npm start, the website is on localhost:3000

At last, Have a good day!
